Reading list management using org-mode. A sample list lives on my wiki [[https://lepisma.xyz/wiki/readings/reading-list][here]].

[[file:./screen.gif]]

** Quickstart
~org-books~ is available on melpa.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Set path to the reading list org file
(setq org-books-file "~/my-list.org")

;; A basic template file can be generated using the function `org-books-create-file'.
#+END_SRC

- To add books manually, use ~org-books-add-book~ function. To add from urls, call
  ~org-books-add-url~ (or use ~org-books-cliplink~ if url is in clipboard).

- To give ratings, go to the entry and call ~org-books-rate-book~.

- While filing a book, ~org-books-file-depth~ tells which headings are to be
  considered as a category (like fiction or something).

- ~org-books-add-to-top~ (default ~t~) tells whether to add the book at the top or
  bottom under the selected heading.

** Adding new source
A /source/ for books provide a /details function/ that takes certain input (like a
url in case of amazon) and returns a list of ~title~, ~author~ and ~props~. ~props~ is
an alist which gets added to the entry as org properties. Here is the output
from amazon's:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports both :results output
(print (org-books-get-details-amazon "https://www.amazon.in/Algebra-Chapter-Graduate-Studies-Mathematics/dp/0821847813/"))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ("Algebra: Chapter 0 (Graduate Studies in Mathematics)" "Paolo Aluffi" (("AMAZON" . "https://www.amazon.in/Algebra-Chapter-Graduate-Studies-Mathematics/dp/0821847813/")))

With the details function defined, you need to write the url pattern it accepts
and add it to the variable =org-books-url-pattern-dispatches=. Check variable's
docstring for more details.

As of now there are the following sources:

- Manual (input: title, author etc.)
- Amazon (input: url)
- Goodreads (input: url)
- Openlibrary (input: url)
- ISBN (input: ISBN, dispatches openlibrary url source)

** Using org-capture
For a more flexible setup, you might just want to use ~org-capture~, possibly with
a little help from functions present in this package. Directly using capture
gives you much more flexibility over the structure and organization of entries.
Here we describe a few capture /templates/ that can be used:

*** Manual entry

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-capture-templates
        '(("b" "Book" entry (file "some-file.org")
           "* %^{TITLE}\n:PROPERTIES:\n:ADDED: %<[%Y-%02m-%02d]>\n:END:%^{AUTHOR}p\n%?" :empty-lines 1)))
#+END_SRC

*** Using url from clipboard

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-capture-templates
        '(("b" "Book" entry (file "some-file.org")
           "%(let* ((url (substring-no-properties (current-kill 0)))
                    (details (org-books-get-details url)))
               (when details (apply #'org-books-format 1 details)))")))
#+END_SRC
